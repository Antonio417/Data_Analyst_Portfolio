## Aim
Danny requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.
All datasets exist within the `pizza_runner` database schema.

## Available Data

### Table 1: `runners`

The `runners` table shows the `registration_date` for each new runner

| runner_id | registration_date |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1         | 2021-01-01        |
| 2         | 2021-01-03        |
| 3         | 2021-01-08        |
| 4         | 2021-01-15        |

### Table 2: `customer_orders`

Customer `pizza orders` are captured in the `customer_orders` table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.

The `pizza_id` relates to the type of pizza which was ordered whilst the `exclusions` are the `ingredient_id` values which should be removed from the pizza and the `extras` are the `ingredient_id` values which need to be added to the pizza.

Note that customers can order multiple pizzas in a single order with varying exclusions and extras values even if the pizza is the same type!

The `exclusions` and `extras` columns will need to be cleaned up before using them in your queries.

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions          | extras              | order_time          |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

### Table 3: `runner_orders`

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The `pickup_time` is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. The `distance` and `duration` fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

There are some known data issues with this table so be careful when using this in your queries - make sure to check the data types for each column in the schema SQL!

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance | duration   | cancellation            |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| 1        | 1         | 2021-01-01 18:15:34 | 20km     | 32 minutes |                         |

### Table 4: `pizza_names`

At the moment - Pizza Runner only has 2 pizzas available the Meat Lovers or Vegetarian!

| pizza_id | pizza_name  |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | Meat Lovers |
| 2        | Vegetarian  |

### Table 5: `pizza_recipes`

Each `pizza_id` has a standard set of toppings which are used as part of the pizza recipe.

| pizza_id | toppings                |
|----------|------------------------ |
| 1        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 |

5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

### C. Ingredient Optimisation

View my solution [here](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Pizza-Runner/Ingredient%20Optimisation.md)

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
3. What was the most common exclusion?
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
- Meat Lovers
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
- Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
6. For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"
7. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

### D. Pricing and Ratings

View my solution [here](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Pizza-Runner/Pricing%20and%20Ratings.md)

1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
- Add cheese is $1 extra
3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id
- order_id
- runner_id
- rating
- order_time
- pickup_time
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas
5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
