### 2. How many unique customer orders were made ?

````sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_customer_orders
FROM
  pizza_runner.customer_orders
GROUP BY
  customer_id
  ````
  
| customer_id | unique_customer_orders |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 101         | 3                      |

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner ?
Orders can be cancelled. Cancelled orders can be found as shown below
````sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  pizza_runner.runner_orders
WHERE
  length(cancellation) > 0
  ````


| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance | duration  | cancellation            |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 6        | 3         | null                | null     | null      | Restaurant Cancellation |

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered ?

Join the `pizza_names` table to get pizza names, and join the `runner_orders` table to exclude cancelled orders.

````sql
SELECT pizza_name, COUNT(pizza_name)
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names AS n ON c.pizza_id = n.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE
  pickup_time != 'null'
  AND distance != 'null'
  AND duration != 'null'
GROUP BY pizza_name
  ````

| pizza_name | number_of_pizzas_delivered |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Meatlovers | 9                          |
| Vegetarian | 3                          |

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer ?
Calculate the number of ordered pizzas and exclude cancelled orders. Join two tables: pizza_names and runner_orders to exclude cancelled orders.
````sql
SELECT customer_id, pizza_name, COUNT(pizza_name) AS number_of_pizzas_delivered
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names AS n ON c.pizza_id = n.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE
  pickup_time != 'null'
  AND distance != 'null'
  AND duration != 'null'
GROUP BY customer_id, pizza_name
ORDER BY customer_id
  ````
  
| customer_id | pizza_name | number_of_pizzas_delivered |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2                          |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 2                          |
| 102         | Vegetarian | 1                          |
| 103         | Meatlovers | 2                          |
| 103         | Vegetarian | 1                          |
| 104         | Meatlovers | 3                          |
| 105         | Vegetarian | 1                          |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order ?

````sql
SELECT MAX(items) AS max_number_of_orders
FROM 
(
SELECT c.order_id, COUNT(c.order_id) AS items
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders r
ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE
  pickup_time != 'null'
  AND distance != 'null'
  AND duration != 'null'
GROUP BY
  c.order_id
    ) AS temp_table
  ````

| max_items_in_order |
| ------------------ |
| 3                  |

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes ? 
````sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  changes,
  COUNT(changes) AS number_of_changes
FROM
  (
    WITH ranked AS (
      SELECT
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS rank
      FROM
        pizza_runner.customer_orders
    )
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      c.order_id,
      CASE
        WHEN exclusions ~ '^[0-9, ]+$'
        OR extras ~ '^[0-9, ]+$' THEN 'Have changes'
        ELSE 'No changes'
      END AS changes,
      rank
    FROM
      ranked AS c
      JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE
      pickup_time != 'null'
      AND distance != 'null'
      AND duration != 'null'
    GROUP BY
      exclusions,
      extras,
      customer_id,
      c.order_id,
      rank
  ) AS changes
GROUP BY
  changes,
  customer_id
ORDER BY
  customer_id
  ````
| customer_id | changes      | number_of_pizzas |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 101         | No changes   | 2                |

| 105         | Have changes | 1                |

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras ?

  CASE
    WHEN exclusions ~ '^[0-9, ]+$'
    AND extras ~ '^[0-9, ]+$' THEN 'Have exclusions and extras'
