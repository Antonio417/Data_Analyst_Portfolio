## Aim
Use data to answer a few simple question about customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with customers will help the owner deliver a better and more personalised experience for their loyal customers. These insights will be used to help decide whether the expansion of existing customer loyalty program is needed.

## Available Data
Danny has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:
- `sales`
- `menu`
- `members`

### Table 1: `sales`

The `sales` table captures all `customer_id` level purchases with an corresponding `order_date` and `product_id` information for when and what menu items were ordered.

| customer_id | order_date | product_id |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| A           | 2021-01-01 | 1          |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | 2          |
| A           | 2021-01-07 | 2          |
| A           | 2021-01-10 | 3          |
| A           | 2021-01-11 | 3          |
| A           | 2021-01-11 | 3          |
| B           | 2021-01-01 | 2          |
| B           | 2021-01-02 | 2          |
| B           | 2021-01-04 | 1          |
| B           | 2021-01-11 | 1          |
| B           | 2021-01-16 | 3          |
| B           | 2021-02-01 | 3          |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | 3          |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | 3          |
| C           | 2021-01-07 | 3          |

### Table 2: `menu`

The `menu` table maps the `product_id` to the actual `product_name` and price of each menu item.

| product_id | product_name | price |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1          | sushi        | 10    |
| 2          | curry        | 15    |
| 3          | ramen        | 12    |

### Table 3: `members`

The final members table captures the `join_date` when a `customer_id` joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.

| customer_id | join_date  |
|-------------|------------|
| A           | 2021-01-07 |
| B           | 2021-01-09 |

## Case Study Questions 
(Click [Here](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Danny's-Diner/solution.md) for solution)
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
