## Aim
Use data to answer a few simple question about customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with customers will help the owner deliver a better and more personalised experience for their loyal customers. These insights will be used to help decide whether the expansion of existing customer loyalty program is needed.
