# 🍣 Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner
## Solution

***

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant ?

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
ON m.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id
````

#### Steps:
- Use **SUM** and **GROUP BY** to find ```total_spent``` for each customer.
- Use **JOIN** to merge ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables as ```customer_id``` and ```price``` are from both tables.


#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant ?

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date))
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use **DISTINCT** and wrap with **COUNT** to find out the ```visit_count``` for each customer.
- If we do not use **DISTINCT** on ```order_date```, the number of days may be repeated. For example, if Customer A visited the restaurant twice on '2021–01–07', then number of days is counted as 2 days instead of 1 day.


#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.
