| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| 🏨 [Hotel Booking Analysis](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Hotel-Booking-Analysis) | Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization |  Main aim of this project was to explore and analyse reason for canceled room bookings. Also, to find correlation between a variable and how it leads to bookings getting canceled. Variety of variables was analysed such as type of travel agents used, hotel type and room type. Data was visualized to better understand findings. | Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib|
| 💰 [Economic Data Analysis](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Economic_Data_Analysis) | Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization |  The aim of this project was to analyse trends resulting from growing prosperity of different countries. Selected metrics was used to determine reasons behind any interesting findings. Hypothesis were made before investigating and confirmed through analysis. Data was visualized to better understand and forces the data to explain itself. | Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib|
| 📊 [Diamond Multivariate Analysis](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Multivariate_Data_Analysis) | Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization | The aim of this project was to find how each feature of a diamond affects the price and which feature was the most important one. Finding the right way to best visualize univariate, bivariate and multivariate relationship within them was also investigated.| Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Math and Matplotlib|
| 📈 [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/LinearRegression) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Linear Regression model to predict the output of a variable based on a dependent variable. In this project the dataset comes from the in-built make_regression function from sklearn | Numpy and scikit-learn_ |
| 📉 [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/LogisticRegression) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Logistic Regression model to predict the output of a variable based on a dependent variable. In this project the dataset used to train and test the model was the breast cancer dataset from sklearn | Numpy and scikit-learn_ |
| ⚙️ [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/SVM) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Supervised Learning models to solve a two-group classification problem. In this project the dataset comes from the in-built make_blobs function from sklearn | Numpy and scikit-learn_ |
