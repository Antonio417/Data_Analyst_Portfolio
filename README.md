| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üè® [Hotel Booking Analysis](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Hotel-Booking-Analysis) | Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization |  Main aim of this project was to explore and analyse reason for canceled room bookings. Also, to find correlation between a variable and how it leads to bookings getting canceled. Variety of variables was analysed such as type of travel agents used, hotel type and room type. Data was visualized to better understand findings. | Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib|
| üí∞ [Economic Data Analysis](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Economic_Data_Analysis) | Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization |  The aim of this project was to analyse trends resulting from growing prosperity of different countries. Selected metrics was used to determine reasons behind any interesting findings. Hypothesis were made before investigating and confirmed through analysis. Data was visualized to better understand and forces the data to explain itself. | Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib|
| üìä [Diamond Multivariate Analysis](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Multivariate_Data_Analysis) | Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization | The aim of this project was to find how each feature of a diamond affects the price and which feature was the most important one. Finding the right way to best visualize univariate, bivariate and multivariate relationship within them was also investigated.| Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Math and Matplotlib|
| üìà [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/LinearRegression) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Linear Regression model to predict the output of a variable based on a dependent variable. In this project the dataset comes from the in-built make_regression function from sklearn | Numpy and scikit-learn_ |
| üìâ [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/LogisticRegression) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Logistic Regression model to predict the output of a variable based on a dependent variable. In this project the dataset used to train and test the model was the breast cancer dataset from sklearn | Numpy and scikit-learn_ |
| ‚öôÔ∏è [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/SVM) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Supervised Learning models to solve a two-group classification problem. In this project the dataset comes from the in-built make_blobs function from sklearn | Numpy and scikit-learn_ | 

# Excel
| Project Name | Area | Description | Tools and Functions |   
|---|---|---|---|
| [Home Luxury Kitchen Dashboard](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Excel%20Projects) | Data Analysis, Dashboard Design and Development | Analysing data from scratch to answer questions on sales and visualize results for ease of explanations. Dashboard provided could show sale performance for each product and trends on customer preferences in each selected state or year. | Pivot Table, Charts, Maps, Slicers, Data Validation, IF, SUMIFS, TRANSPOSE, LARGE and INDEX |
| [Adidas Dashboard](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Excel%20Projects) | Dashboard Design and Development | This project main aim was to provide a dashboard that could help the management team to understand better how sales was distributed across states, how each retailers contribute to their sales and how the sales were done (online, outlet or in-store) and it provide informations on the trend of sales each year for each respective products. | Pivot Table, Charts, Maps and Slicers |
| [Coca-Cola Dashboard](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Excel%20Projects) | Dashboard Design and Development | Dashboard provided could be use to show shareholders on the performance of their company. This dashboard also provide information on sales of each products and trends within respective months selected.| Pivot Table, Charts, Maps and Slicers |
