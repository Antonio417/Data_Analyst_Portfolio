# 🗺 Data Analytics Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio 🙌🏽
Here I provide a brief explanation to all of my data analytics projects.
Feel free to click on the project name!
## 📚 Table of Contents
- [Python](#python)
- [SQL](#sql)
- [Tableau](#tableau)

# Python 
Skills: Data Cleaning, Visualization, Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning
Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplotlib
| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| 📈 [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/LinearRegression) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Linear Regression model to predict the output of a variable based on a dependent variable. In this project the dataset comes from the in-built make_regression function from sklearn | Numpy, scikit-learn_ |
| 📉 [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/LogisticRegression) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Logistic Regression model to predict the output of a variable based on a dependent variable. In this project the dataset used to train and test the model was the breast cancer dataset from sklearn | Numpy, scikit-learn_ |
| 📈 [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/Antonio417/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/Python/SVM) | Machine Learning | I learn how to create and train a Supervised Learning models to solve a two-group classification problem. In this project the dataset comes from the in-built make_blobs function from sklearn | Numpy, scikit-learn_ |
